# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

This project analyzes data from the App Store and Google Play to identify patterns that can help developers create profitable mobile applications.

## Project Overview
The goal is to determine the types of apps that are likely to attract more users and generate higher revenue on both platforms.  
This is achieved by examining factors such as:
- App category
- Pricing model
- User ratings
- Installs
- Market trends

## Dataset
The analysis uses two datasets:
- [**Google Play Store**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps/data): Contains app details such as name, category, size, installs, price, and rating.
- [**Apple App Store**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/data): Contains app details such as name, genre, size, price, and rating.

These datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to remove duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant entries.

## Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Removal of duplicate and irrelevant entries
3. Analysis of popular app categories
4. Analysis of free vs paid apps performance
5. Identification of profitable app niches
